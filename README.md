## My Process

To facilitate the process I started this website from a template I created previously.  After that I was able to quickly add pages and switch content around to suit the needs of this particular project.  The template I used can be found here https://artsycoder533.github.io/freelance-template1/

### Challenges 

The biggest challenges I faced was coming figuring out how to tell if a user was on mobile or desktop to determine whether the submenu in the navigation  bar would open on hover or on click.
